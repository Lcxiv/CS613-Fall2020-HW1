# CS613-Fall2020-HW1

Dear Professor Alpay,

I used the jupyter notebook to illustrate the differences between the weights and K used for Question 1. I used scikit learn to choose between the different variables such as weights or K.The python file is the modified version of the code to make it cleaner.

For question number 2. I found a really neat program based on a voronoi function used in scikit learn as well. The main reason I used this program is that they let us change the metric while the scikit one is only usable with the Euclidian metric.

Lastly, the pdf is the written work for the last two questions.

Hope this README helped! :)
